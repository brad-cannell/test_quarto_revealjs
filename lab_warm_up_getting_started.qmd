This presentation is being linked to from index.html. Why would we do this? Because the Poll Everywhere links do work if we just share the HTML file (even with embed-resources: true). They do work when we serve the slide show from gh-pages, but we don't want to create a separate repo for each slide show. Therefore, we can link to the slideshows from the index page of the gh-pages branch.

## Poll Everywhere Live Presentation View {.scrollable}

This slide uses an embedded live presentation view script

::: notes
- Share this link to reveal the real-time chart for your activity.
- I think this is the view I will typically need to use in class.
