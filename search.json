As of this writing, we are still trying to figure out the best option."

Why would we do this? Because the Poll Everywhere links don’t work if we just share the HTML file (even with embed-resources: true). They do work when we serve the slide show from gh-pages, but we don’t want to create a separate repo for each slide show. Therefore, we can link to the slideshows from the index page of the gh-pages branch?"
