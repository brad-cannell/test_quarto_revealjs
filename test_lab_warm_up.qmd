## In class lab warm-ups

At the beginning of each in-person lab session students will complete a warm-up together as a class, along with the instructor, using a series of interactive poll questions that provide immediate feedback. These activities will not be graded; however, participating gives students an opportunity to self-assess their comprehension and ask questions.

## Poll Everywhere

Why are we switching from Socrative to Poll Everywhere?

  1. We (UTHealth) have an institutional Poll Everywhere paid account.
  
  2. Hopefully, we wonâ€™t have to switch back and forth between Socrative, RStudio, and PowerPoint during the lab warm-up. The idea is that we will be able to embed text, R code, R results, and poll questions directly into RevealJS slides or PowerPoint. As of this writing, we are still trying to figure out the best option.

## Embed a Poll Everywhere Activity

- The blog post
  - <https://support.polleverywhere.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260801821849-Embed-an-activity>{target=_blank}
  
Step 1. [Create a poll everywhere activity](https://www.polleverywhere.com/home){target=_blank}.

Step 2. Add activities to the RevealJS slides using embed code. See the blog post from slide one.

## Current issues {.scrollable}

After creating a RevealJS slide deck, Poll Everywhere activities aren't displayed when we open the slides by double-clicking the HTML file.

- Is this because only one activity can be active at a time?

- Is it still an issue if we serve the slides from GitHub pages?

- Is it still an issue if we try a different embed type (i.e., Response link, PollEv page, or Live presentation view)

- Can I use index as a series of links to other slide shows? Why would we do this? Because the Poll Everywhere links don't work if we just share the HTML file (even with embed-resources: true). They do work when we serve the slide show from gh-pages, but we don't want to create a separate repo for each slide show. Therefore, we can link to the slideshows from the index page of the gh-pages branch?

## Poll Everywhere Response Link {.scrollable}

This slide uses an embedded response link script

<iframe src="https://pollev-embeds.com/multiple_choice_polls/FPlbstLvb1V50ATBZLzIj/respond" width="800px" height="600px"></iframe>

::: notes
Use this link to collect responses even when the activity is not activated. Participants can respond asynchronously or over a long period of time.
:::

## Poll Everywhere PollEv Page {.scrollable}

This slide uses an embedded PollEv page script

<iframe src="https://pollev-embeds.com/cannell" width="800px" height="600px"></iframe>

::: notes
- Use this page to present an activity to a live audience. The page will always display the activity that is currently activated on the account.
- You have to actually go into Poll Everywhere and click the "Activate" button.
- Don't forget to click "Deactivate" when you're done.
:::

## Poll Everywhere Live Presentation View {.scrollable}

This slide uses an embedded live presentation view script

<iframe src="https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/Sj2BkUh8EID48gQPtbpWN?controls=none&short_poll=true" width="800px" height="600px"></iframe>

::: notes
- Share this link to reveal the real-time chart for your activity.
- I think this is the view I will typically need to use in class.

<!-- Use a horizontal rule to create a new slide without a title -->

::: notes
- Same slide as before. This time there just isn't a title to the slide.

## Sharing slides

1. You can publish on GitHub. See the [Test Quarto Book](https://brad-cannell.github.io/test_quarto_book/chapters/slide_presentations.html) for Details.

2. You can [share as a PDF file](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf). 

3. You can create a self-contained HTML file by adding the `embed-resources: true` option to the yaml header.

::: notes
- It seems like the Poll Everywhere questions don't work if we use the `embed-resources: true` option.
- In fact, it seems like the Poll Everywhere questions don't work unless I'm actively rendering the document from an RStudio session.
- It does seem to work when I publish to GitHub, though.

## Serving from gh-pages

Do the Poll Everywhere iframe's work if I serve the slides from gh-pages?
